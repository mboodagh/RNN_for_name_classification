# RNN_for_name_classification
Recurrent neural networks have shown promising capabilities for text classification. In this code, we utilize two different RNN structures to classify the names. The file "data" contains a list of names corresponding to different nationalities. This project aims to predict the nationality of human names using different RNN structures.
